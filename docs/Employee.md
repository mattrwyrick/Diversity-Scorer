## About
Employee is the node class within an organizational tree. It has a unique id, a dictionary of attributes describing its 
demographic, and also contains a list of other Employees it manages. If an employee is a leaf node (e.g. bottom of the 
organization tree like an analyst) this manages field is an empty list.
